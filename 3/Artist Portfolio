Antonio is an old school art collector from Italy. He has been using computers for a few years with a help of his grandchild.  Antonio would go to the artist's portfolio after seeing her exhibition in Rome, just to get the contact information of the gallery she works with. He is contemplating on contacting the artist herself hoping to get a better price on her next work.
