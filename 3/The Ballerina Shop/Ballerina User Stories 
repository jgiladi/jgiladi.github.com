 Alina is a ballerina from the Moscow Bolshoi Ballet. She needs to buy ballet shoes and ballet clothes for rehearsal. She also needs to buy ballet shoes for her performances. Alina needs a consistent shoe type and therefore she needs a site where she can re-order based on previous requirements. 

Natasha is the mother of a 7 years old ballet student. Her daughter requires a new pare of shoes every few months for her ballet practice. Since she is still growing and her size is changing she has to come in person into the store to check the shoe. Natasha is a busy working mother. She would go to the web site to check the opening hours of the store and the directions.
